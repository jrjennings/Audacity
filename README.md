+ Add an android cell phone for its computing power and sensors.
+ Add bluetooth module to provide communication between cell phone and Arduino.
+ Add camera for machine vision to locate orange cone.
+ Add ultrasonic sensors for obstical avoidance.
+ Add a bumper that doubles as a touch sensor.
+ Add tire to wheel for durability and more grip on smooth surfaces.
