 <p>
First this modification adds a TPU printed tire to a wheel that has had the tread removed.
Second, since I've modified the drive to gear motors, and the gear motors I've purchased have dual bearings, I've done away with the original shaft and bearings and attaced the wheel directly to the gearmotor using a motor shaft adaptor.
